### Introduction

The primary goal of our study is to implement a risk protocol for alerting people of higher risk of disease transmission based on mosquito abundance data. This system will generate alerts when mosquito abundance reaches critical thresholds specific to malaria and dengue fever. The methodology involves determining these thresholds, implementing a risk function, testing, and deploying the system within the CADP (Community Alert and Decision Platform).

### Risk Protocol Development

#### Determine Mosquito Abundance Threshold For Malaria

- **Rationale:** Malaria transmission is heavily influenced by the density of Anopheles mosquitoes, which are the primary vectors for the disease.
- **Methodology:**
  - Review existing literature and data on malaria transmission rates and mosquito abundance.
  - Analyze historical data to identify the mosquito density associated with increased malaria cases.
  - Conduct statistical analysis to determine the threshold beyond which the risk of malaria transmission becomes significant.

knitr::include_graphics('images/mosquito_disease_mapping_malaria.jpg')
```
  - Determining the appropriate thresholds requires field validation.
    - It is crucial to collaborate with researchers specializing in infectious diseases to obtain and analyze empirical data.
    - Such a partnership will provide the necessary insights to refine the risk models and ensure that the alert system is based on accurate, real-world data.
    
- **Hypothesis:** There exists a specific mosquito abundance threshold that significantly elevates malaria transmission risk.
- **Analysis:** Use regression models to correlate mosquito abundance with malaria incidence rates.
- **Results:** Document the identified threshold and justify its selection based on statistical significance and literature review.

#### Determine Mosquito Abundance Threshold For Dengue Fever

- **Rationale:** Dengue fever is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, and its incidence is linked to the abundance of these vectors.
- **Methodology:**
  - Review existing literature and data on dengue transmission rates and mosquito abundance.
  - Analyze historical data to identify the mosquito density associated with increased dengue cases.
  - Conduct statistical analysis to determine the threshold beyond which the risk of dengue transmission becomes significant.

```

### Implementing The Risk Function In R

#### Develop The Risk Function

- **Rationale:** To automate the generation of alerts based on the identified thresholds for malaria and dengue fever.
- **Methodology:**
  - Define the risk function parameters, including mosquito abundance, location, and disease type.
  - Implement the function in R, ensuring it accurately triggers alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

```
  - The default_malaria_risk function is designed to assess the risk of malaria transmission based on mosquito abundance data. The function takes three inputs: a data frame df containing time-series data, and two thresholds—th.prevalance for mosquito abundance and th.growth_rate for the growth rate of malaria prevalence. Here’s a breakdown of how the function works:
    - **Sorting Data by Time:**
        - The function first orders the input data frame df by the time column to ensure that the data is in chronological order. This is crucial for accurately calculating the growth rate over time.
    - **Mapping Mosquito Abundance to Malaria Prevalence:**
        - The function extracts mosquito abundance data from the data frame and passes it to the map_abundance_to_prevalence_malaria function. This function is a placeholder that currently returns a direct mapping of abundance to prevalence (a 1:1 relationship). The result is stored in the prevalence variable.
    - **Calculating Growth Rate:**
        - The growth rate of malaria prevalence is calculated by comparing the prevalence at each time point with the previous one. The growth rate is computed as a percentage change from the previous prevalence value. The first value is set to 0 because there’s no prior data point to compare.
    - **Generating Risk Alerts:**
        - The function then checks if the calculated prevalence and growth rate exceed the specified thresholds (th.prevalance and th.growth_rate). A Boolean vector (bool) is created, where each element indicates whether both conditions are met at each time point.
        - The elements of this vector are named using a sequence like d0, d1, etc., corresponding to the time points.
    - **Returning the Results:**
        - The function returns a list containing the prevalence threshold, growth rate threshold, and the Boolean vector of alerts. This list can be used to identify periods of high risk for malaria transmission.
        
    - **Note:** This function is a prototype and uses a dummy protocol, meaning it does not rely on actual research data. The final implementation will require field validation and collaboration with experts to develop an accurate model for mapping mosquito abundance to malaria prevalence.

```
  - The default_dengue_risk function is designed to evaluate the risk of dengue fever transmission based on mosquito abundance data. This function is similar to the default_malaria_risk function, with adjustments to account for the specifics of dengue fever. Here’s a detailed breakdown:
    - **Sorting Data by Time:**
      - The function begins by ordering the input data frame df by the time column to ensure that the data is processed in chronological order. This step is essential for accurately calculating the growth rate over time.
    - **Mapping Mosquito Abundance to Dengue Prevalence:**
      - The mosquito abundance data from the data frame is extracted and passed to the map_abundance_to_prevalence_dengue function. This function currently acts as a placeholder, directly mapping mosquito abundance to disease prevalence (a 1:1 relationship). The resulting prevalence data is stored in the prevalence variable.
    - **Calculating Growth Rate:**
      - The growth rate of dengue prevalence is computed as the percentage change between consecutive time points. This is done using the diff function, which calculates the difference between successive prevalence values, divided by the previous value. The first growth rate is set to 0 as there is no prior data point for comparison.
    - **Generating Risk Alerts:**
      - The function then generates a Boolean vector (bool), indicating whether both the prevalence and growth rate exceed the specified thresholds (th.prevalance and th.growth_rate). If both conditions are met at a given time point, the corresponding element in the vector is set to TRUE.
      - Each element of this vector is named according to the time points (e.g., d0, d1, etc.).
    - **Returning the Results:**
      - The function returns a list that includes the specified prevalence threshold, growth rate threshold, and the Boolean vector of alerts. This list serves as an output to identify periods of heightened dengue transmission risk.

    - **Note:** This implementation is a prototype using a dummy protocol. It does not reflect actual research data. Future development will involve field validation and collaboration with experts to create an accurate model for dengue prevalence based on mosquito abundance.

- **Analysis:** Validate the function through unit tests and simulations.
- **Results:** A functional risk algorithm capable of real-time alert generation.
