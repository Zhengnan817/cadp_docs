## Our Kanban process

We follow a Kanban process that Brian perfected over six years.
The approach is designed to minimize coordination time and miscommunication
in a distributed and asynchronous collaboration environment.
The process was successful during COVID while managing a remote team in
the Philippines. 

### Lean production
Kanban literally means "sign board" in Japanese.
Its history is steeped in lean production and like most of lean production,
its genesis occurred at Toyota.
To really understand the Kanban approach it's necessary to understand
a bit about lean production,
and in particular the concept of efficiency and waste.
Our starting assumption is that we want to optimize processes so they
are maximally efficient.
What does it mean to be efficient?
One definition focuses on what it isn't or doesn't have, which is waste.
Lean production aims to remove as much waste from a process as possible.
The more waste is removed, the more efficient the process.

Lean production defines seven wastes, often abbreviated as TIMWOOD.
These are

- transportation
- inventory
- movement
- waiting
- over production
- over processing
- defects

While the original context was physical production, 
the seven wastes of lean transfer remarkably well to business processes,
software development, and even AI systems.

### Loose coupling and asynchronous communication
The original kanbans were pieces of paper that were placed at the bottom of a
parts bin. This sign board communicated to the consumer of those parts that
it was time to get more parts. They would take the card to the producer of
those parts so they could begin making more.

Kanban is thus an integral part of just-in-time (JIT) production,
where said production is driven by a pull process (initiated by demand).
The genius of kanban is that each producer operates independently and
coordination is asynchronous. An effective kanban process doesn't
require a lot of meetings nor does it require a lot of coordination.
All it requires is *an understanding of and adherence to the process*.

### Kanban for project management
Outside of a physical production process,
a centralized kanban board can mediate communication between relevant parties.
Each person fulfills a particular role and has certain actions they can take.
Note that a person can fulfill multiple roles.
For software, the roles can include:

- product owner: responsible for defining requirements and setting priorities
- individual contributor: responsible for implementing requirements
- tester: responsible for testing implementations and documenting errors
- deployer: responsible for deploying code to different environments


The kanban itself is simply a set of columns in a particular order.
The columns hold cards or stories that define work to be done.
While any columns are allowed, I use this set as a standard:

- ideas
- backlog
- in progress
- blocked
- for review
- done
