## Our Kanban process

We follow a Kanban process that Brian perfected over six years.
The approach is designed to minimize coordination time and miscommunication
in a distributed and asynchronous collaboration environment.
The process was successful during COVID while managing a remote team in
the Philippines. 

### Lean production
Kanban literally means "sign board" in Japanese.
Its history is steeped in lean production and like most of lean production,
its genesis occurred at Toyota.
To really understand the Kanban approach it's necessary to understand
a bit about lean production,
and in particular the concept of efficiency and waste.
Our starting assumption is that we want to optimize processes so they
are maximally efficient.
What does it mean to be efficient?
One definition focuses on what it isn't or doesn't have, which is waste.
Lean production aims to remove as much waste from a process as possible.
The more waste is removed, the more efficient the process.

Lean production defines seven wastes, often abbreviated as TIMWOOD.
These are

- transportation
- inventory
- movement
- waiting
- over production
- over processing
- defects

While the original context was physical production, 
the seven wastes of lean transfer remarkably well to business processes,
software development, and even AI systems.

### Loose coupling and asynchronous communication
The original kanbans were pieces of paper that were placed at the bottom of a
parts bin. This sign board communicated to the consumer of those parts that
it was time to get more parts. They would take the card to the producer of
those parts so they could begin making more.

Kanban is thus an integral part of just-in-time (JIT) production,
where said production is driven by a pull process (initiated by demand).
The genius of kanban is that each producer operates independently and
coordination is asynchronous. An effective kanban process doesn't
require a lot of meetings nor does it require a lot of coordination.
All it requires is *an understanding of and adherence to the process*.

### Kanban for project management
Outside of a physical production process,
a centralized kanban board can mediate communication between relevant parties.
Each person fulfills a particular role and has certain actions they can take.
Note that a person can fulfill multiple roles.
For software, the roles can include:

- product owner: responsible for defining requirements and setting priorities
- individual contributor: responsible for implementing requirements
- tester: responsible for testing implementations and documenting errors
- deployer: responsible for deploying code to different environments


The kanban itself is simply a set of columns in a particular order.
The columns hold cards or stories that define work to be done.
Each column represents the state of the cards within the column.
While any columns are allowed, I use a standard set. 
Figure \@ref(fig:kanban-states) shows the relationship between the column states 
and how cards can move between those states.

```{r kanban-states, echo=FALSE, engine='tikz', out.width='90%', fig.ext='png', fig.cap='A state diagram representing where cards can move from each column. The starting state is always Ideas, and the end state is always Done.'}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node[rectangle,draw, minimum height=1cm, minimum width=3cm] (ideas) at (0,2) {Ideas};
\node[rectangle,draw, minimum height=1cm, minimum width=3cm] (backlog) at (4,2) {Backlog};
\node[rectangle,draw, minimum height=1cm, minimum width=3cm] (progress) at (8,2) {In Progress};
\node[rectangle,draw, minimum height=1cm, minimum width=3cm] (blocked) at (8,0) {Blocked};
\node[rectangle,draw, minimum height=1cm, minimum width=3cm] (review) at (12,2) {For Review};
\node[rectangle,draw, minimum height=1cm, minimum width=3cm] (done) at (16,2) {Done};

\draw[-stealth] (ideas) -- (backlog);
\draw[-stealth] (backlog) -- (progress);
\draw[stealth-stealth] (progress) -- (review);
\draw[stealth-stealth] (progress) -- (blocked);
\draw[-stealth] (review) -- (done);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

Here is a description of each column state:

- ideas: represents a proposed work item. Anyone can add a card to ideas, but only the product owner can move a card from ideas into the backlog.
- backlog: represents prioritized work that has (sufficiently) complete requirements. This column acts as a queue.
- in progress: represents work that is actively being worked on. Individual contributors move cards from the Backlog into In Progress and assign themselves to the card. To minimize ambiguity, there should be one card owner that is ultimately responsible for the completion of the card. Typically people add an update each day they work on the card. This is critical as it provides visibility into the process and eliminates the need for status updates or in-person meetings!
- blocked: represents a stuck state, where an external situation is preventing forward progress. Card owners move cards from In Progress to Blocked and must include an explanation of the blocker. The card owner is responsible for coordinating the solution to unblock the card. Once a card is unblocked, the card owner moves the card back to In Progress.
- for review: when work is finished on a card (code complete), the card owner moves the card to For Review. She must tag a reviewer and follow up to ensure the card is reviewed in a timely manner. Depending on the team, a reviewer can be another individual contributor or the product owner. If there is significant work to be done for a review, the card owner may move the card back to In Progress. For simple issues, it can remain in For Review.
- done: work that has gotten a successful review is moved here by the card owner. It is up to the team to agree on the definition of "done". This state can signify code has been merged to the master branch, deployed into a particular environment, or something else.
