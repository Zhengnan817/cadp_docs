# Physical Infrastructure

Devices can connect with the CADP via different means.
Figure \@ref(fig:device-networking) shows two different approaches.
The simplest approach is to connect directly via WiFi.
In this approach, a device communicates directly with the CADP MQTT server.
This approach works well when reliable WiFi is available.

```


The method used for remote areas with limited infastructure utilizes
a mobile phone as an intermediary.
In this approach we assume that mobile phones (with a network connection)
exist in proximity to devices but they are no fixed internet gateways.
We call the mobile phones ephemeral gateways because they may disappear 
at any time.

Ephemeral gateways (EGs) offer a temporary network connection. 
The EG is responsible for pushing data to the CADP MQTT server.
If a network connection is unavailable, 
it will cache the data on the mobile phone until a network connection is
available.
Once a connection is established, the EG must push the data to the server.

Devices are connected together via the LoRa wireless protocol.
When a particular device connects with an ephemeral gateway,
it broadcasts a message to other connected devices and notifies them
that it has a network connection.
This device will attempt to upload as much data to the mobile device as
possible.

Devices that receive this message will begin broadcasting data to be received
by the device connected to the EG.
The broadcast includes the ID of the device connected to the EG.
Only the device connected to the EG can broadcast an ack back.

In the event that multiple EGs are available,
each device is responsible for choosing the device to use as the target EG.


## Direct WiFi connections

Devices connected via WiFi will start a MQTT client to send directly to
the cloud MQTT broker.
By default, the MQTT broker host is `mqtt.zeomancer.com`.


## BLE connections

When a smartphone connects to a device via BLE, a few things happen:

- the device sends a test data packet to confirm that data is sent to the MQTT broker
- the device waits for an ack from the smartphone
- if successful,
  - LoRa is activated
  - a `internet_available` message is broadcast over LoRa


### Data routing algorithm

The data routing algorithm solves one key problem, which is the existence
of ephemeral gateways.
Devices are connected to each other via LoRa.
The goal is to efficiently route data through the LoRa network to 
devices that are connected to the network (a "connected device").
LoRa works via a broadcast mechanism, so devices are either 
in range or out of range of a connected device.

If a device is in range, then the device simply broadcasts its data to
the target connected device.
Any other device that receives the message will ignore the message
if the target id does not match its device id.

For a device that is out of range, it will send data to the nearest device
in range of a connected device. 
The devices can be modeled as a graph where each device is a node
and edges represent the signal strength between them.
We can define two relevant distance metrics between two arbitrary nodes:

- the number of edges (aka hops) between nodes;
- the harmonic mean of the signal strength of the edges separating the nodes.

A device chooses a target device by considering the harmonic mean of 
the signal strengths between it and a connected device.
Generally, the device should choose the path with the highest value.
Note that this may change as EGs can move around and disappear altogether.
