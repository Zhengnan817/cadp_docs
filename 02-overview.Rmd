# Overview

The Climate Adaptation Data Platform (CADP) accelerates climate adaptation
initiatives by bringing together multiple stakeholders to addresss
multiple climate-related challenges.
The primary stakeholders are policymakers/governments, farmers, 
and individual members of the community.
The CADP provides tangible value to each stakeholder.

The magic of the CADP is that it breaks through policy paralysis by 
creating the device and data infrastructure that policymakers need to 
drive widespread climate adaptation efforts.
Our hypothesis is that it's unrealistic for municipalities to deploy
and operate sensor networks. 
It's also too complex an undertaking for community groups to take on.

CADP provides an alternate path where individuals and businesses purchase
devices that incrementally build out the infrastructure needed for
policymakers.

This document discusses the different use cases that CADP is designed for
and the value people get from these use cases.
Where applicable, a distinction will be made between 
the value individuals get from the platform versus the value policymakers get.

After describing the use cases, we move into more technical territory
so people can learn how to use and develop the platform further.
First is a high-level view of the physical infrastructure and
the relationship between a device network and the CADP.
Devices are responsible for monitoring environmental conditions
and sending the collected data to the platform.
