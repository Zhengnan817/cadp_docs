The consequences of these changes are just starting to be felt. To avoid widespread suffering, we need to similarly accelerate climate adaptation initiatives. The Climate Adaptation Data Platform (CADP) aims to do just that. By bringing together multiple stakeholders, we can solve multiple climate-related challenges concurrently. This drives down costs and increases reach. Consistent with the above goal, the CADP is an open source project. This guide details how to use and develop the CADP. Those wishing to contribute to the CADP should read this guide first. Those who only want to use the CADP can skip most of the theory and focus on the latter half of the book. 1.1 License Copyright (C) 2024 Zato Novo, LLC.
