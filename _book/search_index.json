The primary stakeholders are policymakers/governments, farmers, and individual members of the community. The CADP provides tangible value to each stakeholder. The magic of the CADP is that it breaks through policy paralysis by creating the device and data infrastructure that policymakers need to drive widespread climate adaptation efforts. Our hypothesis is that it’s unrealistic for municipalities to deploy and operate sensor networks. It’s also too complex an undertaking for community groups to take on. CADP provides an alternate path where individuals and businesses purchase devices that incrementally build out the infrastructure needed for policymakers. Figure 3.1: A prototype weather station device deployed at the University of Dar es Salaam test farm in Tanzania. This document discusses the different use cases that CADP is designed for and the value people get from these use cases. Where applicable, a distinction will be made between the value individuals get from the platform versus the value policymakers get. After describing the use cases, we move into more technical territory so people can learn how to use and develop the platform further. First is a high-level view of the physical infrastructure and the relationship between a device network and the CADP. Devices are responsible for monitoring environmental conditions and sending the collected data to the platform.

CADP accelerate food security and public health initiatives by providing all the infrastructure to automatically incorporate hyperlocal forecasts as a data source for precision agriculture digital advisory services heat-health early warning systems infectious disease early warning systems 4.1 System Requirements 4.1.1 Linux The platform will work on most Debian-based Linux distributions. At a minimum you need to have the following available: bash: this is the command line shell where you can execute commands make: this is a standard tool to build software In a new environment, run the bin/init_workstation.sh script to ensure you have the tools you need to build the system. 4.1.1.1 Windows users If your primary operating system is Windows, you will need to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux. This will give you bash and likely `make. 4.1.1.2 Mac users OS X is built on BSD. Many of the tools have slight differences from GNU Linux. That said, the system should run without issue on Mac OS X. 4.1.2 Docker Docker is required. The version used to create this repo is $ docker --version Docker version 25.0.3, build 4debf41 If you are on Windows, follow the official instructions for installing the Linux Subsystem for Windows and Docker desktop. 4.2 Building the Platform The full platform can be built using the following command: make all This will first build the platform and then launch it. The following tasks are executed: initialize database initialize the dashboard build all images You can use this command repeatedly. The Makefile is smart enough to know not to re-initialize the database. To verify that the system is running, you can check the logs or check the container statuses directly. Logs can be monitored using make logs, while the container statuses can be viewed by typing docker ps. In this latter command, the output should look something like this: $ docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES c86a8b8a34a2 zeomancer_system-weather_forecast &quot;tini -g -- /bin/bas…&quot; 3 hours ago Up 3 hours (unhealthy) 443/tcp, 8888/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8180-&gt;80/tcp, :::8180-&gt;80/tcp zeomancer_system-weather_forecast-1 6e2812b24695 zeomancer_system-simulator_etl &quot;tini -g -- /bin/bas…&quot; 3 hours ago Up 3 hours (unhealthy) 80/tcp, 443/tcp, 8004/tcp, 8888/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8081-&gt;8080/tcp, :::8081-&gt;8080/tcp zeomancer_system-simulator_etl-1 27e46eb20065 zeomancer_system-ecm_etl &quot;tini -g -- /app/zeo…&quot; 3 hours ago Up 3 hours (unhealthy) 80/tcp, 443/tcp, 8004/tcp, 8888/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8080-&gt;8080/tcp, :::8080-&gt;8080/tcp zeomancer_system-ecm_etl-1 5db4dd92afa2 timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg12 &quot;docker-entrypoint.s…&quot; 3 hours ago Up 3 hours 0.0.0.0:5432-&gt;5432/tcp, :::5432-&gt;5432/tcp zeomancer_system-ts_db-1 3bb9e8c4788a nodered/node-red:latest &quot;./entrypoint.sh&quot; 3 hours ago Up 3 hours (healthy) 0.0.0.0:9002-&gt;1880/tcp, :::9002-&gt;1880/tcp zeomancer_system-node_red-1 dc8c438b1bf3 eclipse-mosquitto:2.0.18-openssl &quot;/docker-entrypoint.…&quot; 3 hours ago Up 3 hours 0.0.0.0:1883-&gt;1883/tcp, :::1883-&gt;1883/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9001-&gt;9001/tcp, :::9001-&gt;9001/tcp zeomancer_system-mqtt_broker-1 42c737867360 gcr.io/micro-dynamo-351417/bank-transaction-classification_service &quot;bash&quot; 9 days ago Up 9 days 8080/tcp laughing_mendeleev To stop the platform, just type make stop. You can restart the platform by running make run. The previous state will be retained when you start back up. 4.3 Platform Demos A number of demos can be deployed into your running system. 4.3.1 Get available demos This target shows all the available demos and the regions where stations can be loaded. make list-demos 4.3.2 Deploy a demo Deploying a demo means that all source weather data is downloaded and loaded into the database. Once the source data are loaded, it is possible to run a simulation to show how the system state evolves over time or batch run all the forecasting models and risk rules until an arbitrary end date. The drawback of the simulator approach is that it will take a while to observe. make run-demo During the installation of a demo, you will be prompted to choose whether to continue with running batch forecasts or not. 4.3.3 View dashboard There are two dashboard views. One defines the data processing workflows and is for application developers. The other is for policymakers and shows the device network and corresponding weather and application information. 4.3.4 Reset system To run another demo, you need to reset the system state. A make target makes this a simple task. Be careful: it also makes it easy to lose all your work, since it deletes everything in the database!! make reset 4.4 Viewing the dashboard 4.4.1 Policymaker dashboard The end-user reporting dashboard for decisionmakers and policymakers is located at http://localhost:9002/dashboar/. 4.4.2 System administration dashboard The workflows that define the processing jobs are defined in Node RED. They are accessible at http://localhost:9002/#flow/. "],["use-cases.html", "5 Use Cases 5.1 Public health 5.2 Precision agriculture 5.3 Hotter Times 5.4 Mobile app", " 5 Use Cases Every device powers multiple simultaneous use cases. We call this use case stacking. This is different from re-using or re-purposing a device. With use case stacking, multiple applications run concurrently. The supported use cases depend on the sensors attached. The two main public health use cases only need the base set of sensors, which means anybody with an account can get hyperlocal heat risk and mosquito abundance information. 5.1 Public health 5.1.1 Early warning systems The genesis of this project was the death of 11,000 people in Libya due to a medicane (Mediterranean hurricane) that caused a dam to fail. People were caught off guard because as a failed state, Libya has no functioning weather agency. It turns out that most of Africa has limited weather stations. Most official weather agencies only send out seasonal forecasts. Weather forecasts give people critical time to plan and prepare for major weather events. Building on top of weather forecasts are early warning systems (EWS). These systems apply rules, or risk protocols, to forecasts to determine the level of risk people are exposed to. EWSes can operate on any type of forecast and includes heat risk, air quality risk, the spread of wildfire, the spread of infectious disease, and the spread of pests like the ash borer. The UN declared a mandate that everyone should be covered by an early warning system by 2030. Some $3 billion dollars have been earmarked for this effort. While many countries have early warning systems, many are outdated, no longer work, or cover a limited number of risks. The CADP provides the infrastructure to quickly build EWSes and fulfill the UN’s vision. 5.1.2 Heat risk Survivability is the upper limit of temperature and humidity that humans can withstand. Humidity has a significant impact on the maximum temperature that humans can survive in. With high humidity, the body loses its ability to regulate temperature via perspiration. In some places, climate change is making heat waves more extreme and pushing temperatures to the survivability level. Even if that limit isn’t reached, whether those conditions are livable is another matter. Livability limits help people understand what activities are possible given temperature and humidity (and sun exposure). Figure 5.1 compares livability limits for two population groups and whether the activity takes place in direct sun or shade. Figure 5.1: Livability limits for different METs at different temperature and humidity levels. Source: (Vanos 2023) The conversion formula between METs (\\(M\\)) and calories is \\[\\begin{align} M \\frac{3.5 m}{200} = kcal/min, \\end{align}\\] where \\(m\\) is mass in kilograms. This formula enables us to customize the heat risk of specific activities according to each individual and their specific health conditions. Heat risk builds on the concept of livability. The goal is to provide an EWS that helps people understand their heat risk exposure and make decisions about what activities to do or how to mitigate heat risk during certain activities. As shown in 5.2 the platform currently highlights risks Figure 5.2: A screenshot of a policy dashboard showing active heat risk alerts for two devices. Individuals can get personalized heat risk guidance for any device in CADP. Alerts can be delivered via email or via the mobile app. Users can enter some health information to get better alerts. This information is saved but segregated from personally identifiable information (PII). Relevant health information includes age BMI (weight + height) diabetes heart issues We envision a conversational alert message that doubles as a daily planner. Integrating this information with preferred activities results in specific messaging that informs people of what activities are realistic for a given day. On a very hot and humid day, an older person may want to limit sun exposure to an hour. That might mean that golf should be avoided, whereas a stroll through a shaded park is more appropriate. 5.1.3 Mosquito-borne infectious disease Mosquitos are a common disease vector and can carry numerous infectious diseases, such as malaria, dengue fever, zika virus, yellow fever. Disease outbreaks are driven by the growth of a mosquito population. To limit the severity of an outbreak, mosquito surveillance is conducted to monitor the spread of mosquitos. By tracking mosquito abundance, it is possible to predict how large an outbreak might be. Direct observation of mosquitos is an involved process. It requires specialized devices to attract and trap mosquitos. Usually these devices need periodic cleaning. A simpler approach is to use a mosquito abundance model and build risk protocols on that model. These can be calibrated with physical traps (future). Figure 5.3 shows a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe the change in mosquito abundance given a few parameters. Of importance is that both temperature and humidity drive the population growth of mosquitos. Figure 5.3: A system of partial differential equations that model mosquito population growth based on environmental conditions. Source: (Erraguntla 2021) We can thus use the temperature and humidity forecasts available in the CADP to make mosquito abundance forecasts. Figure 5.4 shows a graph of a device in the CADP. The green line represents observational data, while the orange time series is the forecast produced by the CADP. Figure 5.4: A device detail view showing historical temperature, a temperature forecast, plus heat risk thresholds. 5.2 Precision agriculture Figure 5.5: UDSM professors and agronomy staff standing behind a prototype weather station device. 5.2.1 Dry soil forecasting Forecasting dry soil is the first step in irrigation control. The forecast is simply the moisture content of the soil. 5.2.2 Watering schedules Watering depends on the type of plant growing. Some plants need a lot of water while others don’t. Many plants don’t like wet roots, so watering cannot be too frequent. We need to develop these control models for each plant. 5.2.3 Crop development Water needs change based on the maturity of the plant. Beans need moist soil when pods are forming. To form large roots, beets need minimal water during early growth stages to promote root development. We can extract this data from various agricultural sites, such as the Farmers Almanac. The information needs to be encoded into programmatic rules. 5.2.4 Risk protocol for dry soil Knowing whether soil needs irrigation depends on a few factors. First, the crop determines the general watering schedule. Decisions are made based on reconciling watering needs with current environmental conditions. We need to know the current soil moisture level. We also want to know the future soil moisture level, which factors in weather forecasts. There’s no point watering today if it will rain tomorrow. 5.2.5 Irrigation control Automated irrigation control builds on top of the water needs forecasting model. 5.2.6 Freeze warnings Farmers and gardeners in temperate or similar climates need to know when there are frosts that could damage fragile seedlings. Uncertainty leads to wasted time preparing for non-events or stress worrying about whether plants will be okay. 5.3 Hotter Times This site is used to display public data related to the sensor network. Hotter Times thus becomes a public service where everyone can benefit from the device network. All of the layers discussed above can be displayed on Hotter Times. 5.4 Mobile app A mobile application is used to mediate the network connection for devices in remote areas. It is also used to deliver alerts to users. Using the device as an alert delivery mechanism ensures users have the device installed and able to act as a data transport for devices. References "],["physical-infrastructure.html", "6 Physical Infrastructure", " 6 Physical Infrastructure Devices can connect with the CADP via different means. Figure 6.1 shows two different approaches. The simplest approach is to connect directly via WiFi. In this approach, a device communicates directly with the CADP MQTT server. This approach works well when reliable WiFi is available. Figure 6.1: Different network configuration of system. The method used for remote areas with limited infastructure utilizes a mobile phone as an intermediary. In this approach we assume that mobile phones (with a network connection) exist in proximity to devices but they are no fixed internet gateways. We call the mobile phones ephemeral gateways because they may disappear at any time. Ephemeral gateways offer a temporary network connection. The EG is responsible for pushing data to the CADP MQTT server. If a network connection is unavailable, it will cache the data on the mobile phone until a network connection is available. Once a connection is established, the EG must push the data to the server. Devices are connected together via the LoRa wireless protocol. When a particular device connects with an ephemeral gateway, it broadcasts a message to other connected devices and notifies them that it has a network connection. This device will attempt to upload as much data to the mobile device as possible. Devices that receive this message will begin broadcasting data to be received by the device connected to the EG. The broadcast includes the ID of the device connected to the EG. Only the device connected to the EG can broadcast an ack back. In the event that multiple EGs are available, each device is responsible for choosing the device to use as the target EG.

Figure 8.1: System architecture to generate weather forecasts and monitor devices. The system has two primary sources of data. The first is baseline weather forecast data, produced by the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). This is a global, gridded dataset with 0.4 degree resolution. These forecasts are archived in Amazon S3 and are publicly accessible. The second dataset comes from the devices themselves. The sensor data is used to tune the gridded forecast according to local conditions. 8.1 Design principles Plan for 18 month shelf life Focus on end-to-end infrastructure Stub components where necessary Use concurrency where appropriate to minimize wall time Minimize data movement Minimize cost 8.2 Database 8.3 Sensor data ingestion 8.3.1 Raw sensor data Stored as an unnormalized delimited file.

The first is air_t_h_p, which represents air observations. The key hints that there are three value fields. The second observation type is battery and contains a single reading for the battery level. 8.3.2 Data issues When the device cannot connect to the Internet for a while, it loses it’s internal time, and the clock resets to 2000-01-01. These data points can be dropped. Even if the clock doesn’t reset, there can be clock drift. This can usually be ignored since the observations are aggregated anyway. 8.4 Weather forecasting The system uses the ECMWF global gridded forecast data as a baseline forecast. Local sensor data is integrated into this forecast to produce a more accurate forecast for specific locations. 8.4.1 ECMWF forecasts ECMWF forecasts are updated every six hours. The publicly available AWS archive has a complete history of data. Usage for the bash script that downloads the data appears in Appendix A. There are up to 48 forecast steps per forecast. Each forecast step ranges between 27 MB - 50 MB, which implies a minimum of 1.3 GB of data is retrieved every six hours (per update). To save space, these files need to be slimmed down by removing all unnecessary data. 8.5 Early warning system "],["forecasting-algorithms.html", "9 Forecasting algorithms 9.1 Air temperature 9.2 Soil moisture", " 9 Forecasting algorithms 9.1 Air temperature 9.2 Soil moisture We want to forecast soil moisture based on current environmental conditions. There are four main variables that likely drive soil moisture: air temperature air humidity precipitation current soil moisture We can use a recursive least squares (RLS) implementation as a starting point. This is the same approach used for the temperature forecast, so it should be straightforward to modify. Predicting soil moisture is confounded by the fact that a change in moisture can be driven by weather but also human intervention. The latter case will create spikes in soil moisture data. These need to be handled with care to avoid erroneous model behavior. "],["risk-protocols.html", "10 Risk Protocols 10.1 Soil moisture", " 10 Risk Protocols 10.1 Soil moisture Forecasting dry soil is the first step in irrigation control. The forecast is simply the moisture content of the soil. When soil moisture reaches a certain level, an alert needs to be generated. A risk protocol defines the soil moisture level that triggers an alert. The risk protocol is governed by a few factors: associated crop growth stage of crop Each plant has its own water needs, so risk protocols need to be plant-specific. We assume the soil moisture sensor is for horticulture or agriculture, so there is a specific crop that the sensor is associated with. This could be an herb, a vegetable, or even an ornamental. Water needs vary depending on the growth stage of the plant. When beets are young, they are intentionally stressed with less water to promote root development. Beans need plenty of water during pod formation. To simplify the model, we can ignore the growth stage aspect of the plant and pick one value.
